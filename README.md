# NotteLabs - Reliable Web Agents

> use our reliable web agent API to order free merch!

**TLDR;** We’re building a full-stack platform to deploy reliable web browser agents that can scrape and take action on any site. This makes it possible to automate hard web workflows even when there’s no API or MCP server. We focus it all on reliability and scale for enterprise.

**Want to try it?** We’re giving away $200 of NotteLabs merch to be ordered by an agent! No catch - this is the only way we thought would incentivize some of you to test our agents and give us some feedback. So here you go - just copy paste and run this code to order (first come, first served)

# How to run the agent

```bash
pip install notte-sdk
python agent.py
```

Don't forget to update your name and shipping address in the script !
